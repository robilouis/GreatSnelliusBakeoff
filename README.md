Tons of cookies, tons of liquor

### To-do
- Find one or several recipe datasets to extract cookie recipes (look at simple PIERRE paper for database source?)
    - Found a dataset made of $\sim$ 220 recipes but pretty average recipes
    - Needs some more original and/or cake recipes
- Make a squeleton of the algorithm/re-use the colab from the tutorial
- Adjust the fitness function to make it relevant (yet simple)
- Mutation/crossover function to adapt?
