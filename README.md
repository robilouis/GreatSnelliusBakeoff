Tons of cookies, tons of liquor

### To-do
- Find one or several recipe datasets to extract cookie recipes (look at simple PIERRE paper for database source?)
- Make a squeleton of the algorithm/re-use the colab from the tutorial
- Adjust the fitness function to make it relevant (yet simple)
- Mutation/crossover function to adapt?
